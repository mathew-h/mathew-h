### Hello! My name is Mat (yes, with one 't'), and I'm currently learning the basics of computer science via CS50, Harvard's "Introduction to Computer Science" course.
### I'm a 4th year chemical engineering student at Northeastern University and I'm interested in machine learning for biochemical reaction systems.
